# Tic Tac Toe Game using React.js

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using React.js. It allows two players to take turns and play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe.


## Features

- Two players can take turns to play.
- Displays the current player's turn.
- Detects winning combinations and announces the winner.
- Handles a tie when the board is full.
- Reset button to start a new game.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns by clicking on empty cells to place their symbol (X or O).
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the source code. Here are some ideas:

- Change the styling and layout of the game board.
- Add animations for when a player wins or when the board is reset.
- Implement a computer AI to play against the player.
